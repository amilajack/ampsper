# AMPSPER

A simple skeleton Ghost theme that uses [Google AMP](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml)

Version: 0 as AMP is a newborn

# Installation

Create a new directory called ampsper, under /themes of your Ghost installation.

Activate theme from your settings.

Note: The /assets folder remains in case we prefer adding in custom styling and functions

# Adding custom style to your Ghost blog

Add the following section within your Ghost custom Header with the necessary format.

```
<style amp-custom> </style>
```

# Future
